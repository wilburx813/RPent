PROVEN_LEVERS = """These are battle-tested on seed 0 of THIS suite. You are now running a DIFFERENT
seed — object/fixture positions differ, so RE-LOCALIZE everything per scene
(never hard-code an xyz). But the TECHNIQUES and the per-task target zones
transfer directly. For your task, FIRST read the solved seed-0 reference (if
present): `resources/libero/results_*_pert/<seed-0 tag>.json` (+
`recipe_<seed-0 tag>.jsonl`)
— it has the winning strategy_notes and command sequence for the SAME task at
seed 0. Reuse its approach; re-derive every coordinate from THIS scene.
The recipe is ONLY the command sequence. You must ALSO read the matching task
memory (WORKFLOW step 1) — it carries the WHY, the parameter ranges, and the
failure modes you need to adapt the recipe to this seed. A recipe read without
its memory is half the picture; consult BOTH before planning.

CRITICAL MECHANICS (cost many wasted attempts before they were nailed):
- **GRIPPER SIGN**: in `move_to` / `set_gripper`, `gripper:+1` = CLOSE/hold,
  `gripper:-1` = OPEN. To CARRY a grasped object, hold `gripper:+1` the whole way
  (carrying with `-1` silently OPENS and drops it — the #1 early bug). `set_gripper +1`
  (steps 8-12) firms the grip after a pick; for a laterally-weak CAN use steps<=5.
- **`move_pose` defaults gripper to OPEN (-1) if you omit it** — always pass
  `"gripper":1` in `move_pose` while holding an object.
- **`move_pose` threads the OSC IK singularity that `move_to` walls at** — for
  cabinet-front / microwave-cavity / deep reaches, when `move_to` stalls
  (final_dist stays high, eef retreats), switch to `move_pose` (co-vary
  xyz+pitch+yaw). It reaches several cm deeper.

GRASPING:
- **MUGS / BOWLS / CUPS grasp at the RIM, not the center**: SAM3/back-projection
  give the object CENTER; closing the gripper there grabs air. Aim
  `eef_y = object_y + 0.045` so Pi0 rim-hooks. (Mugs do NOT hang 4.5cm in -y like
  bowls — you can wrist-segment the grasped object to measure the true held offset.)
- Some objects grasp best with `pi0_pick` from the **DEFAULT HOME pose** (no
  pre-position) — Pi0 has its own approach trajectory; pre-positioning can hurt.
- **`pi0_pick` is reusable and repurposable**:
  a HIGH `lift_thresh` (e.g. 999) + `gripper_closed_thresh:0` turns it into a
  generic closed-loop CONTACT driver (used to turn the stove knob).
- **`pi0_doubled`** = Pi0 closed-loop CONTACT skill (success :=
  `libero_terminated`). Use it for drawer/door open-close AND insertions; call it
  repeatedly.

DISAMBIGUATION / TARGETING:
- **SWAP-PERTURBED scenes (suite `*_swap`)**: the seed-0 reference's COORDINATES
  are STALE (swap re-randomizes object positions per seed), and some s0 swap
  recipes contain a literal reset — that was the old multi-attempt era UNDOING A
  WRONG-OBJECT FIRST GRAB. You cannot reset. Use the s0 ref ONLY for: WHAT the
  targets are (task_language nouns), what they LOOK like, and which Pi0 prompt
  finally worked — never for positions, never replay its command list.
  IDENTIFY-then-GRASP: before ANY pick, identify the target SEMANTICALLY in the
  global agentview, then use the wrist only for geometry. The wrist camera is a
  near-vertical close-up: it is excellent for precise depth/xy refinement, but
  weak at reading side labels or distinguishing similar grocery items
  (ketchup/BBQ/tomato sauce, soup cans, cream cheese/butter). Do NOT let the
  wrist freely re-identify a non-basket target; it often locks onto a look-alike.
  Instead: choose the target from `image_cam_hi_NN.png`, compute its agentview
  xyz, move over that candidate, project/track that SAME candidate in wrist, and
  refine only its surface/center coordinates. SAM3 scores ~0.02-0.06 on brand
  nouns ("alphabet soup", "tomato sauce") — prompt by colour+shape ("the short
  red-label can") or pick pixels manually in the agentview hi-res. Pi0's own
  prompt grounding is ALSO unreliable on brand nouns (s0's first grab took a milk
  carton instead), so pre-position the eef directly OVER the agentview-identified
  + wrist-refined target before pi0_pick. A wrong first grab usually
  tips/displaces the grabbed object AND the target zone — identification errors
  are unrecoverable; spend commands on agentview ID, not on recovery.
- **"left"/"right" in libero_10 is EGOCENTRIC (robot frame): +y = robot-LEFT =
  image-RIGHT.** A geometrically-perfect placement of the WRONG target never fires
  the predicate — when a clean placement won't terminate, SUSPECT WRONG-TARGET
  before wrong-physics (this turned a "physically impossible" verdict into a solve).
- Containers can be MOVABLE (e.g. a basket slides when bumped) — descend into the
  interior CENTER from straight above, not against the rim; SAM3's centroid of a
  frame-clipped/reflective container is rim-biased, so derive the true cavity
  center from the woven-rim pixels.

PER-TASK RECIPES THAT WORKED AT SEED 0 (adapt coords to your seed):
- 2-items→basket (t0,t1,t7): place the BOX first into the EMPTY basket interior
  (descend deep, release), then drop/`pi0_pick`-lift the CAN in beside it; a
  rim-perched item can be seated with a closed-gripper downward push.
- mugs→plates (t4) / mug→plate (t6): rim-grasp, +1-hold carry, descend until the
  mug rests on the plate before release (high release → topples off).
  ⚠ t4 SINGLE-ATTEMPT LEVERS (READ — the seed-0 "win" quietly used 2 resets; you
  have NONE. 8/9 multiseed cells died to the SAME chain: Pi0 rogue-place →
  tipped mug → unrecoverable cascade. Prevent it up front):
    1. GRASP-ONLY pi0_pick: short prompt ("grasp the yellow mug" — NEVER the full
       task_language) AND `max_chunks<=8`. With 20-25 chunks Pi0 keeps driving its
       trained pick-AND-PLACE and dumps the held mug at its own trained "left"
       (+y) or at the workspace IK edge (|y|>0.27 walls z>=0.56 — unreachable
       forever). Stop Pi0 at lift; if lift isn't reached within 8 chunks,
       RE-ISSUE pi0_pick rather than raising max_chunks.
    2. The instant lift is detected: `set_gripper +1` (steps 8-12) to lock the
       grip, then YOU script the entire carry + place (Rule 1 — Pi0 never places).
    3. Measure the held-mug offset PER PICK by wrist-segmenting the HELD mug
       (offsets differ pick-to-pick: dy=-0.055 on one grasp, -0.013 on the next —
       measure each, never reuse). Place eef = plate_center − offset; descend to
       z~0.46 until the mug RESTS on the plate (OSC stalls ~0.51), then release
       and retreat STRAIGHT UP (step_clip 0.012).
    4. ORDER/PATH: after placing mug #1, plan mug #2's pick pre-position AND
       carry path so they NEVER pass over the placed mug (a graze re-tips it). A
       tipped mug is UNRECOVERABLE (no side-grasp primitive; Pi0 won't engage
       side-lying cylinders) — prevention is everything.
    5. Plates MOVE per seed (y=±0.21 at s0, ±0.30 at s8): re-localize each plate
       rim with the wrist cam and use the x_range/y_range MIDPOINTS as the true
       center (the visible-fragment median is edge-biased).
- stove (t2): turn the knob with `pi0_pick "turn on the stove", lift_thresh:999,
  gripper_closed_thresh:0`; then grasp the pan by its HANDLE, re-segment mid-carry
  to converge on the burner.
- moka→stove (t8): grasp body, carry LOW (~4cm lift) in tiny hops (step_clip
  0.006-0.01), re-clamp `set_gripper +1` between hops; "LEFT" = +y pot.
- bottle→bottom drawer + close (t3): the drawer In-region is SHALLOW
  (y≈0.075-0.227) — place at the MOUTH (y≈0.13), NOT the deep recess; `pi0_pick`
  the bottle from home pose, `rotate_pitch` it flat ALONG X (the wide footprint),
  release at the mouth, ONE short +y push seats it AND closes the drawer.
- mug→microwave + close (t9): the only UNSOLVED seed-0 cell — the round mug-in-hand
  walls ~3cm short of the In() threshold (deep narrow cavity). Try every lever
  (`pi0_doubled`, `move_pose`, push) and if it still walls, write an honest
  `libero_terminated:false` with the max eef-y reached."""

GOAL = """YOUR GOAL: produce `state.libero_terminated == true` in ONE episode. ⛔ NO
`reset`, NO retry (SINGLE-ATTEMPT MODE — see the override at the very top; it
supersedes any reset/retry wording in the Rules below)."""

RULES = """Rule 0 — USE IMAGES. After every primitive tool call, inspect the returned state
   and image paths. If you need a state again, call `view_driver_state`. Read the
   new `image_cam_hi_NN.png` path (calibration frame — the one you pick pixels in)
   and, when close to a target, the `image_wrist_hi_NN.png` path. The image is
   your spatial-reasoning input; `states.json` only gives proprioception + object
   names.

Rule 1 — Pi0 is ONLY for the grasp. Use:
     pi0_pick({
       "prompt": "<carefully chosen prompt>",
       "max_chunks": 20,
       "lift_thresh": 0.05,
       "gripper_closed_thresh": 0.06
     })
   YOU do every `move_to` and the `release`. NEVER let Pi0 finish the place.
   ⚠ Do NOT pass object pose / tracking oracles unless explicitly running a
   debug/oracle ablation. The GT object-lift oracle leaks privileged coords and
   can mis-fire when two objects share a name. You judge the grasp YOURSELF — see
   Rule 1b.

Rule 1b — JUDGE THE GRASP from perception, NOT from a name. After a pick, decide
   "did I grab the target?" from two coord-free signals:
     • GRIPPER (proprioception): `state.robot0_gripper_qpos` from the latest
       `states.json` entry — fingers closed but NOT fully shut (~0.01–0.05 gap)
       ⇒ holding an object; fully closed (~0.0) ⇒ grasped air.
     • WRIST CAM: Read `image_wrist_hi_NN.png` after lifting. The target should
       now be raised into the gripper, and the spot it came from should be EMPTY.
       Compare before/after wrist or agentview evidence; if needed, use
       `back_project` on wrist pixels to confirm the target surface z jumped up.
   `pi0_pick.success` (eef-lift + gripper-closure heuristic) is a HINT, not
   proof — always confirm with the wrist cam before carrying.

Rule 2 — Inspect THEN act. Call `view_driver_state({"step": 0})`, read the
   returned high-resolution image path(s), and inspect the relevant memory/guides
   BEFORE your first primitive. **Your task is `states.json[0]["task_language"]`
   — read it and obey it verbatim.** This is the authoritative instruction (the BDDL
   `:language` tag). Do NOT infer the task from object names, from sibling
   recipes, or by guessing a task_map index — those caused wrong-task runs in the
   past.

Rule 2b — NEVER read the BDDL files / import the benchmark / query env object
   poses. The BDDL is FORBIDDEN: it carries the `:init` ground-truth coordinates
   that perception-isolated mode exists to withhold — reading it (even just for
   the language) breaks the experiment. You already have the task from
   `task_language`; you get object positions ONLY by camera images, depth, and
   `back_project` below.

Rule 2c — GROUND THE TARGET BY ITS SPATIAL RELATION, not by its name. When the
   task names a relation ("the bowl ON THE COOKIES BOX", "the mug LEFT OF the
   plate"), the target is whichever object SATISFIES that relation in the scene —
   find it by perception, not by guessing which `_1`/`_2` name it is. Identical
   objects (two `akita_black_bowl_*`) carry NO perceptual difference in their
   names, so the name is useless for choosing; the RELATION is what disambiguates:
     • "on the cookies box" ⇒ the bowl that is ELEVATED (sits ~0.03–0.06m above
       the table, on top of the box) — distinguish it from the table-level bowl by
       its higher world-z from `back_project`.
     • "left/right/front/back of X" ⇒ compare back-projected world xy to X's xy.
   Pick the target purely from where things ARE. Object NAMES are only needed if a
   primitive asks for one (and in this mode none do — Rule 1).

Rule 2d — CLASSIFY THE DESTINATION SURFACE SEMANTICALLY (RGB) BEFORE PLACING.
   Depth/world-maps can locate a flat disc but CANNOT tell you WHAT it is — a
   plate, a stove burner/cook-region, a wooden-cabinet top, and a pot lid all read
   as "flat disc at table height" in back-projected coordinates. They are only
   separable in the RGB. So before you carry-and-release onto a surface, look at
   `image_cam_hi_NN.png` (and the wrist `image_wrist_hi_NN.png` once close) and
   NAME each candidate surface:
     • PLATE ⇒ ceramic disc, usually white, with a clean raised rim (often colored
       concentric rings). This is the place target for "place it on the plate".
     • STOVE BURNER / cook-region ⇒ darker gray metal disc with coil/grate rings,
       sits on the stove fixture; looks ring-patterned like a plate but is NOT one.
       Only the place target when the task says "on the stove / cook region".
     • CABINET top / drawer slot / basket ⇒ match to the noun in `task_language`.
   In kitchen scenes there are frequently TWO ring-discs (a burner AND a plate) at
   nearly identical height — do NOT pick the first flat disc your z-scan finds.
   Decide which noun the `task_language` names, classify each disc in RGB, and only
   then localize the matching one. If a `release` onto your chosen surface does not
   fire the predicate, RE-CLASSIFY (you likely placed on the look-alike) before
   assuming the grasp or the bowl was wrong — a non-firing predicate is as often a
   wrong-SURFACE error as a wrong-object one.

Rule 3 — Pi0 IS the delivery service; walk the prompt ladder before scripting:
     1. "pick up the {object}"  2. the `task_language` verbatim  3. spatial qualifier
     4. re-position pre-pos (lower z, offset xy 5cm) and retry Pi0.

Rule 4 — ⛔ SINGLE ATTEMPT, NO RESET (overrides any reset/retry text). This is a
   one-shot eval: you get ONE episode. Do NOT call `reset`. Within this single
   episode you MAY recover in place (re-localize, re-pre-position, re-`pi0_pick` a
   missed grasp, climb the Pi0 prompt ladder, re-firm the grip,
   `rotate_pitch`/`move_pose`) — that is still one continuous attempt — but you
   may NOT restart the episode. When the task terminates, OR when your single best
   sequence is exhausted (you'd otherwise want to reset), STOP and write the audit
   (success or honest `libero_terminated:false`), then call `finish`.
   NO teleport primitives (set_object_pose / articulate_to / js_move_to /
   carry_object — deleted/forbidden; a goal past OSC reach is approached
   physically or honestly reported, never warped). NO object world coords are
   provided — you MUST localize via perception (below)."""

LOCALIZATION = """This is the core of perception-isolated mode. To find where an object is:

1. Look at `image_cam_hi_NN.png` (1024x1024 — PREFER THIS; fall back to the
   256 `image_cam_NN.png` only if the hi file is absent) and find the target
   object's pixel (row, col). (row = vertical/y from top, col = horizontal/x
   from left.)
2. Call `back_project` on that pixel:

       back_project({"row": ROW, "col": COL, "step": NN})

   It uses the high-resolution world map by default. Pass `"resolution":"low"`
   only if the pixel came from a 256x256 image. The geometry (K⁻¹ back-projection
   + extrinsic) is already done for you. Just use the returned `world_xyz`; do
   NOT write back-projection math yourself unless debugging a tool failure. NEVER
   mix hi-res pixels with low-res world maps or vice versa.

   The returned value is the object's SURFACE point under that pixel. For a
   grasp/place target use its x,y; for z use the object's resting height (sample a
   pixel on the bare table next to it, or use table z ~0.9 kitchen / ~0.42
   table-top).
3. Sample a few pixels on the object and median the world xy — robust to a single
   mis-picked pixel. (Tip: avoid pixels on the object's thin rim/edge or the gap
   to the table — those index a background/edge depth and give a world point
   metres away. Pick pixels firmly on the object's top surface.)

ALWAYS apply the manipulation offsets from memory to the PERCEIVED position
(e.g. BOWL: eef_y = plate_y + 0.045). Verify visually in image_cam after moving."""

PERCEPTION_ALGORITHM = """This is the default perception algorithm for EVERY cell (from the 80-task
localization sweep: `agentview_identity_wrist_geometry_except_basket`).
Agentview chooses WHAT the target is; wrist refines WHERE that already-chosen
candidate is. Do NOT invert those roles.

CORE RULE:
  • Non-basket objects/surfaces: agentview hi-res is the semantic AUTHORITY.
    The wrist is ONLY a geometry/depth refinement camera for the SAME agentview
    candidate. NEVER let the wrist freely re-identify a non-basket target — in
    failed probes the wrist locked onto a look-alike hundreds of pixels away
    while agentview had the right one.
  • Basket / basket_cavity: wrist MAY also confirm/refine, because a basket is a
    geometric container and the close view finds the true interior center (not
    the rim). Basket failures are rim/edge bias, not semantic confusion.

ALGORITHM (run this BEFORE manipulating):

1. From `states.json[0]["task_language"]` + `image_cam_hi_00.png` +
   object_names, infer the task-relevant TARGETS and DESTINATIONS (language only;
   never BDDL/poses).

2. GLOBAL SEMANTIC PASS (agentview hi-res): in `image_cam_hi_NN.png` choose each
   target/destination candidate by RGB, label/shape, and global spatial relation.
   For duplicates (two bowls/plates/mugs) pick by RELATION (on stove, on cookie
   box, left/right/front/back), not `_1/_2`. For sauce/can/box groceries use the
   front/side label + package shape + colour + layout — top-down wrist label
   reading is NOT trustworthy. Classify destination surfaces (plate vs stove
   burner vs cabinet/drawer vs basket) semantically in RGB here.

3. COARSE XYZ (agentview): pick 3-8 pixels firmly on the chosen candidate in
   `image_cam_hi_NN.png`, call `back_project` on the SAME pixels, take the median.
   Avoid edges/holes/shadows/table-gaps. This median is the IDENTITY ANCHOR for
   that entity.

4. WRIST GEOMETRY REFINE (non-basket): `move_to` ~15-20cm above the agentview
   anchor xy, then refine the SAME candidate's surface/center from the wrist:
     - accept a wrist xy ONLY if it is within ~3-5cm of the agentview anchor;
     - if the wrist xy jumps >5cm, REJECT it (it hit a look-alike/background) and
       keep the agentview xyz, or nudge and re-observe;
     - the wrist may NOT override the agentview semantic choice — it only sharpens
       coordinates when geometry is consistent.

5. BASKET SPECIAL CASE: for `basket`/cavity, agentview finds it globally, then the
   wrist confirms/refines the true INTERIOR center (place objects at the open
   interior, not the rim/outer wall). Re-localize the cavity if the basket moved.

6. MANDATORY PRE-TASK PERCEPTION PASS — DO NOT START MANIPULATION UNTIL THIS
   TABLE EXISTS in your reasoning. One row per task-relevant entity (every movable
   target, every destination/support/fixture, every relation landmark), each with:
     - name_or_role (e.g. target_1, basket_cavity, plate_surface, stove_region)
     - agentview_evidence (why this is the right semantic candidate/relation)
     - agentview_pixels_rc (3-8 hi-res pixels) + agentview_xyz (median back_project)
     - wrist_refine: accepted | rejected | basket_confirmed (+ wrist_xyz if kept)
     - final_xyz (what you will plan with)
     - uncertainty (indistinguishable can, duplicate class, basket rim bias, …)
   If an entity is too ambiguous to identify, SAY SO before acting — do not let
   Pi0 or the wrist make a free semantic choice for you.

7. FINAL READY CHECK before the first pick/place: every target+destination has a
   final_xyz; non-basket wrist refinements are spatially consistent with
   agentview; basket/cavity points are interior-centered; manipulation offsets are
   planned from the perceived final_xyz. If this fails, keep perceiving — only
   then start the manipulation plan. Re-verify with the newest image after every
   command and update the table if anything moves.

(xyz from agentview and wrist `back_project` are in the SAME world frame,
directly comparable. Do NOT blindly average them — accept wrist coords only when
consistent with the agentview anchor, or for basket/cavity geometry.)"""

WORKFLOW_STEPS = (
    """READ MEMORY FIRST — a general skill library (operating wisdom, magic numbers,
gotchas, and reusable manipulation patterns), indexed by:
  `resources/libero/memory/MEMORY.md`
Scan the index, then `read_text_file` the few leaf memories most relevant to
your cell. They are not all named `feedback_*`, and the index lines do not spell
out every scene a memory covers — so SEARCH the library yourself rather than
reading the index alone: `list_dir` `resources/libero/memory/` to see every
memory file, and pick candidates by the objects, container, fixture or motion
your scene involves (wording taken from your task description works as a search
key too). If a shell / grep tool is available to you, `grep -rl "<keyword>"
resources/libero/memory/` jumps straight to the files that mention your objects
— use it when you can; otherwise fall back to `list_dir` + `read_text_file`. A given theme often has several near-identical skill files (e.g.
multiple stove / basket / mug patterns that differ only in WHICH objects or step
order). When it does, do NOT pick from the one-line index or stop at the first
name — `read_text_file` the top candidates and choose the one whose objects,
spatial relation and step order actually match YOUR scene, deciding from the file

coordinate by perception in YOUR scene.
⭐ MANDATORY — do this even when a seed-0 recipe exists: the recipe gives the

so you must consult the memory too, not skip straight to replaying the recipe. In
your final `strategy_notes`, RECORD the exact memory file name(s) you read (or

localize EVERYTHING first, THEN act. Before any pick/place build the

median xyz, wrist geometry refinement for non-basket rows (only if spatially
consistent), wrist confirmation for basket/cavity. This perception pass is the
first stage of EVERY task, even ones that look simple — a wrong-target first
grab is unrecoverable in single-attempt mode, so the cheap insurance is to
identify all entities up front. Do the FINAL READY CHECK, then plan.

Each primitive tool blocks until the next `states.json` entry is dumped and

+ high-resolution image paths (+ `back_project` as needed), decide, repeat
with NN=02, 03, ...

(SINGLE-ATTEMPT MODE). FORBIDDEN: `exit`, `set_object_pose`, `articulate_to`,

⚠ INFRA NOTE: `pi0_doubled` IS implemented and callable in this runtime —
verified. It runs the Pi0 VLA on a CONTACT skill (drawer/door open-close, knob
turn) with success := `libero_terminated` (no lift / no gripper-close
assumption — unlike `pi0_pick`). If ANY prior note or reference for this cell
concluded that `pi0_doubled` is "unknown action" / missing / that
drawer-or-door articulation is an unsolvable "structural dead-end" BECAUSE no
contact primitive existed — DISREGARD that specific conclusion and actually
USE `pi0_doubled` for the drawer/door step, alternating with short capped OSC
pushes/aligns as needed. Re-prove the cell from scratch; do not inherit the
dead-end verdict.

SAM3 localization aid — `segment` (no robot motion): instead of eyeballing
a pixel, call `segment({"prompt":"the black bowl on the cookies box",
"camera":"agentview"})`. It runs SAM3 on the current image, back-projects the
mask via the matching world map, and writes `segments/segment_NN_XX.json` with a robust
median `world_xyz` (+ a `segments/segment_overlay_NN_XX.png` to confirm the right
object). Use `camera":"wrist"` (after parking the eef ~15–20 cm over the
target) for ±1–2 cm refinement, or `"point":[row,col]` for a point prompt.
Text `prompt` and `point` are mutually exclusive; provide exactly one.
⚠ PROMPT PHRASING (SAM3 is sensitive): use a plain colour+shape+RELATION phrase,
NEVER the internal/brand name from `object_names`/BDDL. `"the akita black bowl"`
scores ~0.03 (SAM3 can't ground "akita") whereas `"the black bowl on the stove"`
scores ~0.76. Strip proper nouns (akita, glazed_rim_porcelain_…) — say what it
LOOKS LIKE + where it is. Always inspect the returned overlay path to confirm
the mask landed on the right object before moving.
This is a CONVENIENCE alternative to manual back-projection — if it returns
`{"error":..., "fallback":...}` (server down / low score / no detection), walk
the prompt (drop the brand word, add the relation) or just pick a pixel in the
high-resolution image and call `back_project` yourself. It does NOT replace the
two-camera relation protocol for disambiguating identical objects.
