       RPent (Recursive Physical Agent) is an open framework for building
       embodied agents that continuously evolve through recursive interaction
       with the physical world. Rather than prescribing a single foundation
       model, RPent provides a recursive agent framework that harnesses
       heterogeneous intelligence, including perception, reasoning, memory,
       execution, and self-evolution, into a unified physical agent. Through
       continuous interaction, reflection, and adaptation, RPent enables
       physical agents to acquire new capabilities and evolve beyond their
       initial design.

      What RPent is, what the pentagram + ∞ logo means, and the
      high-level architecture at a glance.

   .. grid-item-card:: Installation
      :link: rst_source/installation
      :link-type: doc
      :text-align: center

      Clone RPent and install the whole stack with a single

   .. grid-item-card:: Quick Start
      :link: rst_source/quickstart
      :link-type: doc
      :text-align: center

      Choose a planner, configure the agent, and run one LIBERO task
      end-to-end.

   .. grid-item-card:: Usage Tutorial
      :link: rst_source/usage/configure_planner
      :link-type: doc
      :text-align: center

      Drive the LIBERO / RoboCasa simulators or a Franka / SO-101 arm,
      switch planners, and pick action primitives.

   .. grid-item-card:: Development Tutorial
      :link: rst_source/development/architecture
      :link-type: doc
      :text-align: center

      RPent's implementation-level architecture, plus how to add a new
      robot, a new action primitive, or extend memory.
